          <p class="circleText">Sharing stories and hearing others' stories reminds us of how much we all have in common. When you connect with others on faith to faith, the stories are what you will remember the most. We encourage you to not only share your faith, but to share stories of what your faith means to you. When faith is seen from a human standpoint, as opposed to just a holy book, or a set of guidelines, it becomes more relatable to those who many not know much about it.</p>

          <p class="circleText">Action! This is why we created this site, and this is what we hope you will take forwad with you. Friendships, connections, understanding - these are all important and they have the potential to change the world for the better. However, we have a fear that we are simply preaching to the choir and hope to be able to reach beyond that. Heard an amazing story from someone you spoke with on here? Go out and tell your friends about it! Learned something about a religion you previously knew little about, or had a misconception cleared up? Share the wealth and tell others, they may have the same misconceptions. Act!</p>
